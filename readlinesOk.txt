Python is a high-level, general-purpose programmin
g language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code 
readability with the use of significant indentatio
n.[33]
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-col
lected. It supports multiple programming paradigms
, including structured (particularly procedural), 
object-oriented and functional programming. It is 
often described as a "batteries included" language
 due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the 
late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming l
anguage and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.
9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and intro
duced new features such as list comprehensions, cy
cle-detecting garbage collection, reference counti
ng, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2
008, was a major revision that is not completely b
ackward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2
 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[37]

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popu
lar programming languages.
